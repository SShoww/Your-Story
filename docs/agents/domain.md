# Domain Docs

How engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root, or
- **`CONTEXT-MAP.md`** at the repo root if it exists — it points at one `CONTEXT.md` per context. Read each one relevant to the topic.
- **`docs/adr/`** — read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in.

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront. The producer skill (`/grill-with-docs`) creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## File structure

Single-context repo:

```
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/adr/
└── CoPoject/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When naming a domain concept in an issue title, refactor proposal, hypothesis, or test name, use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept needed is not in the glossary, either reconsider whether the project already has a term, or note a genuine gap for `/grill-with-docs`.

## Flag ADR conflicts

If output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding it.
